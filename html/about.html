        <h3> Education </h3>
        <p> After many long and grueling years studying at Stockport Grammar School, Stockport, Anna went on to spend 3 years studying Zoology at The University of Liverpool in Liverpool.
            Here she gained her degree in Zoology before heading to Canada for a year to recover.</p>
        <h3> Inspiration </h3>
        <p> Anna's love for photography grew whilst she was in Canada, with so much amazing wildlife and breathtaking scenery to snap, she soon became a dab hand with a camera and the idea for our Photography Competition was born.</p>
        <h3>Photo Comp</h3>
        <p> Established in 2007 the Photo Comp aims to help amateur photographers become recognised within the photography community. The winning photographer from each category will receive a contract with an esteemed establishment to help kick start their professional photography career  </p>
